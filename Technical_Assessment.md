# Tech Assessment for Test Automation Engineers

In this test assignment, we would like to ask you to create three small test suites.

## 1. Upload a valid file (PDF) from windows drag drop

we will be testing this system: https://www.ilovepdf.com/merge_pdf

**Use case:** Should drag and drop the PDF file from windows explorer
1.  Navigate onto https://www.ilovepdf.com/merge_pdf
2.	Do not click on the select PDF file button and upload PDF file by using drag and drop the PDF file from windows exploror (File is preaset in spefic location in computer drive)
3.	Verify the visibility of file on the screen
4.	Mover on + icon and click on Upload from computer button
5.	Uplad an other PDF file
6.	Verify the visibity of both the files on the screen
7.	Verify the count of files on + icon

## 2. Upload an invalid verify Toster message

we will be testing this system: https://www.ilovepdf.com/pdf_to_word

**Use case:** Should add new patient detail
1.  Navigate onto https://www.ilovepdf.com/pdf_to_word
2.	click on the select PDF file button and upload an Non PDF file (Like Word file)
3.	Verify the toster message for invalid file

## 3. Excel compare
1. Write a custom function in python and call it to compare excel files using Robot framework.

## Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the requirements have been met. 
However, we understand people have busy lives so feel free to spend no more than 2-3 hours on a submission. 
# You will be ineligible if you take more than 24 hours after receiving the link to share the solution. 
We also take into consideration the answers to the technical questions file and what you would like to have added if you had more time. You should look at this as the complete solution, it's much quicker to explain what you would like to have done than coding it. 

- **You should use "Robot framework" as our Test framework/tool**.

- **Create just one project/repository for both tests**.

- Feel free to use whatever frameworks / libraries / packages you like besides that.

- The code is clean and follows modern patterns.

- Commit messages are clear.

- **Write a README.md** with instructions on how to run your project and your tests.

- Feel free to ask any questions to clarify the Use Case.

## How to deliver this test

- Create a **private repository** on Github and push your code to it. Remember, we will be evaluating your commit messages too, so no big bang commit, please.
- When you are done, invite the user **anandsingh16** **sanjayprakash72** as a contributor to the repo and then **notify us**.
- **If you have any questions, send us a message.**
- Good luck!
